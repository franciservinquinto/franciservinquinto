  <h3 class="w3-center">ABOUT ME</h3>
  <p class="w3-center"><em>I love basketball</em></p>
  <p> Basketball is my favorite hobby of all time! I got involved in basketball because i was interested in the sport and i started playing it everyday from when I completed my college education. Basketball is a great way of exercise and a great way to have fun with friends and possibly make some new ones. I love to watch and play the game, basketball is a very entertaining sport and can be played by anyone. Basketball has many negative and positive things about it based on my opinion. Basketball is known as a good pastime in many peopleâ€™s eyes but can also be seen as a passion for many others The first thing that a basketball represents, for me, is change. Growing up I was a rebel. I never did anything I was supposed or asked to do. I made it a point to rebel against my parents, teachers, and siblings. My parents had no idea where this behavior had come from or how it could be stopped. I was often punished for this behavior that started when I was around the age of 9. My parents thought I had an evil spirit inside of me and soon lost all anticipation. Then there was hope. A basketball coach from A.B.Miller high school saw me and my family at Wal-Mart, and asked for me to be placed on this team. He knew....

    Basketball in my opinion the best thing I can do with my friends to have fun while burning a few calories. I see basketball as fun and easy way to have fun rather than sitting on the couch all day playing video games or watching television. One reason I love basketball is because you need only yourself to play the game or, you can play with teammates.</p>

      <p> When you look at a basketball what do you see? Most would see an orange, sphere, shaped rubber ball. There are black lines and real leather. If you look closer, you would even see the size of the ball in which you are playing with. A basketball could be just a toy for many, or even represent a release for others, but for me, it means a lot more. A basketball represents my blood, sweat, tears, passion, sacrifice, and most of all, a sense of belonging, like a family. At this moment in my life, there are only three things I devote my life to- family, friends, and basketball. Basketball has shaped my life probably more than anything else. Basketball has instilled in me a vicious will to achieve and embrace my ambitions instead of fearing them. Basketball gave me an open opportunity to try something new. New opportunities and experiences are not such a big deal anymore. From academics to personal matters, the lessons that I have learned from basketball has impacted my life.
